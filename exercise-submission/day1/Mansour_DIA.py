GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
WARNING: For Python beginners:
the instructions here will only make sense after you have gone through and
completed the training materials.

1. WHICH PART TO CHANGE?: Uncomment every line with  [YOUR CODE HERE] and replace it with your code.
Please don't change anything else other than these lines.

2. USE OF JUPYTER NOTEBOOK: For those who would like to use Jupyter Notebook. You can copy and paste
each function in the notebook environment, test your code their. However,
remember to paste back your code in a .py file and ensure that its running
okay.

3. IDENTATION: Please make sure that you check your identation

4. Returning things frm function: All the functions below have to return a value.
Please dont forget to use the return statement to return a value.

5. HINTS: please read my comments for hints and instructions where applicable

def return_element_of_a_list(list_of_things, i):
    """
    Return the i-th item of the list
    Example:
    Given list ['a', 'X', 'z'] and i: 2, the function returns 'z'

    """
    The function takes in a list of numbers and returns their mean.
    Example
    Given list [1, 2, 3]), the function returns 2

     Given a persons first and last name, return a combined
     full name with space in between them.
     Example
     Given first name: 'Dunstan' and last name 'Matekenya' the function
     returns 'Dunstan Matekenya'. Note that there need to be space in between

    Given a list, check if item is in the list, return 'YES' if

    Example
    Given list ['a', 'X', 'z'] and item 'M' the function should

    Given a list (which can be nested), write elements of the list to a CSV file.
    Example
    Given list = ['a', 'X', 'z'], the CSV file will will have one row like this:
    'a', 'X', 'z'
    Given list = [['a', 'X', 'z'], ['1', '2', '3']], CSV file will have two rows

    :param csvfile_path: full path of CSV file, when testing, dont forget extension

    # to avoid some problems later, lets remove the file if it exist
    # use if statement and function 'remove()' from os module to achiev this
    # [YOUR CODE HERE]

    # open file object for writing with option "w+"
    # [YOUR CODE HERE]

    # how you write depends on whether the list is nested or not
    # to check is list is nested, use function "isinstance()" to check
    # if elements of the list are also lists
